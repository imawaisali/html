<body style="background-color: blanchedalmond;"><h1> About Me</h1><hr>
    <p style="color:rgb(30, 5, 189)">I'm Awais Ali. I completed my 12th grade in pre-medical with 84% marks in 2021. Sadly, my father passed away, and I took on the responsibility of my family. Now, I work as a clerk at FBR Income Tax, earning enough to get by. I've always had a deep love for computers, so I started a course to learn how to create websites and much more.</p>
    <p>I'm quite the sports enthusiast; I play football and can almost play any sport you name on this planet. I was born in Mardan, a place close to my heart. Keeping fit is important to me, so I love hitting the gym and exercising regularly.</p>
    <p>When it comes to entertainment, I'm a big fan of Hollywood movies and seasons. "Peaky Blinders" is my favorite series, and "The Revenant" tops my list of favorite movies. I also enjoy traveling and have been to some exquisite destinations like Hunza and Kashmir.</p><hr>
