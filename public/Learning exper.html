<h3>A short message for learners who are not motivateed</h3>
<p><i><B>We are limited by our own thoughts, Once we understand that we are capabile
    of doing the impossible we will continue to grow. Just think if some has done it bofore why can't you?
    they have the same brain as you, but they love failures and work hard until success and are not limited by thir thoughts! Thats the only difference
